**Ghost Wall** is a browser extension that detects and blocks third-party tracking scripts on web pages. It gives you visibility and control over which domains are tracking you, and lets you manage your own whitelist and blacklist for maximum privacy.

## Features

- **Detects third-party trackers:** Scans every page you visit and lists all detected third-party scripts and trackers.
- **Blocks trackers:** Blocks known ad, analytics, and social trackers using built-in rules.
- **Custom blacklist/whitelist:** Add or remove domains to your personal blacklist or whitelist.
- **Per-site blocking:** Enable or disable blocking for specific sites with a simple toggle.
- **Domain classification:** Trackers are categorized (Ads, Analytics, Social, CDN, Cloud, Google, Other) and color-coded for easy identification.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive popup with dark mode support.
- **Theme toggle:** Instantly switch between light and dark mode.
- **Manage lists:** Easily view and remove domains from your whitelist or blacklist.
- **One-click blocking/unblocking:** Instantly block or allow any detected domain.
- **Badge system:** Red (danger), Yellow (mid), Green (safe), Grey (other/unknown).
- **Open source:** No hidden tracking, your privacy is respected.
- **Works on all major browsers:** Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, and Firefox (with Manifest V3 support).

## How It Works

- Uses Chrome's [declarativeNetRequest API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest/) to block known trackers.
- Content script scans all `<script>` tags and external resources to detect third-party domains.
- Popup UI shows all detected domains, their category, and allows quick management.
- All settings are stored locally in your browser's extension storage.
- No data is sent to any server; everything runs locally.

## Privacy

Ghost Wall does **not** collect, store, or transmit your browsing data. All detection and blocking happens locally in your browser.
